## Reading Material
One of the best ways to sharpen your Orthic is reading texts written in Orthic.

### Fully-Written Style
Texts in the fully-written style are hard to come by.
Most writing is done in a more abbreviated style.
But there are some!

#### From the Manual
- ["Specimen of Fully-Written Style"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/manual/FullyWrittenStyleSpecimen.png) from the Manual, written by Callendar around 1891 (1 page)
  - Key: [Manual Section]({{site.baseurl}}/manual#specimen-of-fully-written-style)

#### From the Teaching Course
- [Psalms 1–20 in full style]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 1-20 (Full Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) serves as both exercise book and exam for the completion of Lessons 1 through 3. (1896; 16 pages of shorthand)

#### Modern Publications
- [_The Cask of Amontillado_]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/reading/Cask of Amontillado 2020 Sherman.pdf) by Edgar Allan Poe, written by Jeremy W. Sherman in early 2020 (14 pages)
  - Key: [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Late_Edgar_Allan_Poe/Volume_1/The_Cask_of_Amontillado)

### Ordinary Style
Texts in the ordinary style are much easier to come by.
There are numerous specimens between the Manual and Supplement, as well as several texts published by the Cambridge Shorthand Society in the late 19th century or early 20th.

#### From the Supplement
- "Advantages of the Orthographic Basis" from the Manual, written by Callendar around 1892 (3 pages)
    - [Page 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/supplement/OrthographicBasisPage1.jpg)
    - [Page 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/supplement/OrthographicBasisPage2.jpg)

    - [Page 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/supplement/SpeechPage2.jpg)

- ["Lord Salisbury at the Mansion House"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/supplement/VerbatimPage1.jpg) from the Supplement, written by Callendar around 1892 (1 page)
    - **Note:** This is labeled as reporting style, but it's a blurry line indeed.
    - Key: [Supplement section]({{site.baseurl}}/supplement#key-lord-salisbury-at-the-mansion-house)

#### From the Teaching Course
- [Psalms 21–39 in ordinary style]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 21-39 (Ordinary Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) serves as both exercise book and exam for Lessons 4 through 5. (1896; 16 pages of shorthand)

#### Other Cambridge Shorthand Society Publications
- [_Aesop's Fables (Abbreviated) and a Speech in Reporting Style: 'Orthic' Shorthand, Reading Book, Part II_]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/reading/Aesop's Fables in Orthic.pdf)
    - Key to fables: The fables and their morals and applications appear to be drawn from the 1866 publication of [_The Fables of Æsop, translated into English by Samuel Croxall, D.D., with new applications, morals, etc. by the Rev. Geo. Fyler Townsend_](https://archive.org/details/fablesosaesoptr00towngoog/page/n28/mode/2up) Croxall's translations were re-edited and republished for decades, but this version seems to be a word for word match.
    - Key to speech: See the third column from the right, headed "ENGLAND AND THE WORLD", in the [23 May 1898 edition of the New York Sun](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1898-05-23/ed-1/seq-6/). Evidently the speech was given on or just before 14 May 1898, printed in the London Times that day, then part excerpted in the New York Sun a couple weeks later.
- [The New Testament: Authorised Version: written in Orthic Shorthand](https://cdm15457.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15457coll1/id/195/rec/1), written by W. Stevens around 1896ish (i + 170 pages)
    - Key: Any authorized version of the KJV will do. You'll also find this write-up of [Stevens' abbreviating principles](https://redd.it/ag2pq0) helpful, as he uses some tricks covered in neither Manual nor Supplement.

#### Modern Publications
Watch this space. :)

### Abbreviated Style

The abbreviated style incorporates several abbreviating techniques that had previously been thought suitable only for reporting, but that experience prior to publication of the Supplement proved suitable for correspondence.

**Note:** Several of the readings under Ordinary need recategorizing to this section. Also, the Psalms are likely following the Book of Common Prayer, not the KJV.

#### From the Teaching Course
- [Psalms 40–65 in abbreviated style]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 40-65 (Abbreviated Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) serves as both exercise book and exam for Lessons 6 through 8, at which point you’re expected to be writing 60 WPM and reading fluently.


### Reporting Style

#### From the Teaching Course
- [Psalms 66–83 in reporting style]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 66-83 (Reporting Style) 1897 Stevens.pdf) accompanies the second volume of _The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand._ (1897; 16 pages of shorthand)
