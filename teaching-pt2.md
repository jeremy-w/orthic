# The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand, Part 2

Rules for reporting, for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system)

by W. Stevens, secretary to the Cambridge Shorthand Society. 1896.

## Graciously Transcribed by Jacob Moena

This document was transcribed by Jacob Moena in September 2022. He has made available:

* The [transcription's source repository](https://github.com/jacmoe/orthic-teach-part-2)
* A clean [PDF version](https://github.com/jacmoe/orthic-teach-part-2/releases/download/v0922/OrthicTeach2.pdf)
* And even an [ePub version](https://github.com/jacmoe/orthic-teach-part-2/releases/download/v0922/OrthicTeach2.epub)

## Accompanying Readings

- [Psalms 66â€“83 in reporting style [PDF]]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 66-83 (Reporting Style) 1897 Stevens.pdf) serves as both exercise book and exam for the second volume of _The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand._ (1897; 16 pages of shorthand).

## 1. The object of this second Manual

The object of this second manual on the teaching of Orthic Shorthand is
to supply fuller explanations, and illustrations, of the methods of
abbreviation.

## 2. "Reporting Style" is the same methods of abbreviation, extended

The "Reporting Style" of Orthic is in no way essentially different from
the "Corresponding Style."

There is little new to learn, and nothing to unlearn. It is simply the
same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher's Manual, part 1,
extended.

## 3. Abbreviations are no mere arbitraries

Impress, therefore, upon the students that the abbreviations are no mere
arbitraries, but are logical conclusions based upon what has gone
before.

## 4. The alphabet

The only additional character is ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig1.png)
*b* - the upright stroke of the longhand character - which may be
substituted for ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig2.png), see the combination ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig3.png)
*mb*.

This alternative character should only be used medially; as

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig4.png) = *bible*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig5.png) *probably*:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig6.png) equals *but*. Thus ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig7.png)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig8.png).

## 5. -ws final extended to "was"

On page 6, paragraph 7, of the Teacher's Manual, and on page 12 of the
Author's Manual, it has been shown that "ws" final is written with a
loop, thus ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig9.png).

By an extension of this principle, we may use the "ws" loop for the
_word was_, and join it to the preceding word: similarly to "t'was"
in longhand: thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig10.png) = *I was*;
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig11.png) = *it
was*;
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig12.png) *that was*;
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig13.png) *nothing was*;
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig14.png) *if it was*.

## 6. Supra Linear

In the termination "vowel ve", we have the rule
laid down, that the omission of this termination may be indicated by a
dot, or, if inflected, by the inflection written _above_ the last
letter; this was shown to be a logical consequence.

Now this dot, representing the "vowel ve" termination, may very safely
be used to indicate _the verb 'have'_: as

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig15.png) *I
have*. Compare *I've* in longhand.
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig15-2.png) *do have*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig16.png) *will have*.

<abbr title="Nota Bene">N.B.</abbr> This dot cannot clash with _"be"_. Why? Because this word dot
is written _midway between words_; thus, "all that can be said we
have said", ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig17.png).

Naturally following this suggestion, we can deal with "having" in the
same way: as ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig18.png) *not having*, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig19.png)
*not being*.

### 7. Extension of this rule to imply "have"

This supra linear ve dot may be omitted
altogether, and a following word written _in the place of it_, to
indicate the verb "have" understood. Thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig20.png) *to have been*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig21.png) *could have been*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig22.png) *he might have had*.

### 8. Extended to the suffix -ow

This *V Mode* may be extended to the suffix "ow"; thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig23.png) *narrower*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig24.png) *borrow*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig25.png) *borrowing*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig26.png) *sorrow*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig27.png) *sorrowful*.

See [Section 32](#sec-32).

## 9. Implied th- extended to "they"

As given in the manual, initial "th" is omitted and the rest of the word
written _above_ the line.

Extend this principle, and, by placing _the verb above_ the line,
understand the _word they_, omitted. Thus

* *I think they might have
been* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig28.png), cp. *he might have been* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig29.png).

## 10. Sub linear writing

### de-, di-, dis-
As per the Author's Manual, the prefixes
*de*, *di*, and *dis* may be omitted, and the rest of the word written
below the line. Thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig30.png) *declare*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig31.png) *digress*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig32.png) *disciple*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig33.png) *descend*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig34.png) *indisputable*.

### wh-
Further, when a word begins with "wh", the "wh" may be omitted, and the
rest of the word written _below_ the line. Thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig35.png)
*who*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig36.png) *what*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig37.png) *who was*.

### 11. Extension of this rule to "which"

The word "which" is so frequently in use,
that we may safely indicate the omission of the word "which" by writing
the following word _below_ the line, as

* *did you say which it was* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig38.png),
* *which might have been* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig39.png).

Compare the following positions:

1.  ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig40.png) *they might have been*.
2.  ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig41.png) *might have been*.
3.  ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig42.png) *which might have been*.

## 12. Intersections

### For polysyllabic terminations
Many letters in the Orthic alphabet readily
intersect. This method may be used to indicate the omission of one or
two syllables; and it is especially adapted to the expression of
polysyllabic terminations; e.g.

* *g* for *-logical*,
* *a* for *-diate* or *-tiate*,
* etc.

### 13. Outline cutting outline

The termination ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig43.png) *ing*
cutting the last part of a word, signifies the omission of "ish"; thus,

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig44.png) = *flourishing*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig45.png) = *polishing*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig46.png) = *varnishing*.

### 14. The letters A and O intersected

#### A for -ate, -ade, etc.
The vowel *a* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig47.png) will generally intersect another
letter, and may be used to express the terminations

* *tiate*,
* *diate*,
* *ate*, and
* *ade*.

As

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig48.png) *immediate*, or ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig49.png).
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig50.png) *graduate*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig51.png) *initiate*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig52.png) *fade*.

Inflections of the terminations *ate* and *ade* will of course be
indicated by the last letter of the inflection; thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig53.png) *graduated*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig54.png) *actuated*.

#### O for -ote, -ode
Similarly, the vowel *o* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig55.png), may be used to express

* *ote* and
* *ode*;

as

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig56.png) *remote*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig57.png) *antidote*, or ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig58.png).

### 15. P for -ship

P ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig59.png), is already given in the Manual and Supplement,
when intersecting, as equivalent for the termination 'ship', thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig60.png) *marksmanship*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig61.png) *worship*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig62.png) *fellowship*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig63.png) *secretaryship*.

### 16. G for -logue, -logical

G ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig64.png), readily intersects, and may be used for the
terminations _logue_ and _logical_, e.g.

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig65.png) *catalogue*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig66.png) *prologue*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig67.png) *zoological*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig68.png) *phrenological*.

### 17. S for -ious, -ceous

S ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig69.png), when intersecting the last letter can
conveniently stand for any polysyllabic word ending in *ious*, *ceous*,
as

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig70.png) *herbaceous*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig71.png) *extraneous*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig72.png) *expeditious*,
* etc.

## 18. Finals

In abbreviating words ending in

* *ent* use *t*,
* *ence* use *ce*,
* *ency* use *cy*,
* *graph* use *ph*,
* *ism* use *m*,
* *wise* use *se*.

Thus,

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig73.png) *subvent*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig74.png) *evidence*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig75.png) *expediency*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig76.png) *telegraph*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig77.png) *criticism*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig78.png) *otherwise*.

### 19. Y final

#### Joined for -ty, -ary, -ory

Y, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig79.png), final, _when joined to a preceding letter_,
stands for the terminations *ty*, *ary*, or *ory*. Thus,

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig80.png) *duty*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig81.png) *beauty*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig82.png) *lusty*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig83.png) *canary*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig84.png) *ordinary*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig85.png) *story*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig86.png) *conservatory*.

#### Raised for -ity
When written _above_ the last letter, and disjoined, it is the
equivalent for "ity", e.g.

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig87.png) *pity*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig88.png) *sincerity*.

#### Lowered for -ly
When written _below_ the last letter it stands for "ly", as

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig89.png) *truly*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig90.png) *verily*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig91.png) *daily*.

### 20. OU for -ount, -ound

*Ou*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig92.png), stands for the terminations *ount* or *ound*.
Thus,

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig93.png) *count*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig94.png) *county*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig95.png) *profound*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig96.png) *astounding*.

### 21. i for -ite, -ide

On the principle that ![q.e.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig97.png "qe") equals *quite*, and
![w.r.e.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig98.png "wre") equals *write*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig99.png), *i*, will stand
for the terminations "ite" or "ide". E.g.

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig100.png) *bite*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig101.png) *exquisite*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig102.png) *confide*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig103.png) *deride*, etc.

### 22. UN for -ion, -ution, -usion

By the Manual ![u.n.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig104.png "un") is equivalent for "ion"; where, then,
the letter 'u' precedes 'tion' or 'sion', the 't' may be slurred, and
the 'u' lengthened to stand for "ution", or "usion". Thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig105.png) *diminution*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig106.png) *solution*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig107.png) *confusion*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig108.png) *collusion*.

### 23. -um, -ium drop the vowels

The termination "um" and "ium" which occur chiefly in Latin words, may
be abbreviated by omitting the 'u' and 'iu'. *Ium* can be distinguished
from 'um', when necessary, by dotting the "m". Thus

* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig109.png) *laudanum*,
* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig110.png) *sodium*.

## 24. General Abbreviations

When it is desired to abbreviate words
written on the line, and to which the foregoing rules do not apply, it
is usually sufficient to write the first part of the word and the
termination: to follow the usual longhand contraction, as, *st* for
*first*, *ult* for *ultimo*, etc. The great secret is to preserve the
outline of the most important part of the word, cp. *mtg* for
*mortgage*.

### c for 'cause'
In the Manual ![B.E.C.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig111.png "bec") equals *because*, therefore
![C.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig112.png "c") equals 'cause', and may be used for this word.

<!-- JWS: left off editing here, 2023-01-02 -->
## 25

Initial *a* - in words beginning with *anti*, *amphi*, etc. - may be
omitted altogether.

## 26

*Y* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig113.png), detached and below, has been given for the
termination 'ly'. If it is found more convenient, in rapid writing, to
write the 'ly', instead of lifting the pen, it may be done, where it is
not likely to be misread. Thus, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig114.png) for *probably*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig115.png) for ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig116.png) *fully*, etc.

## 27

In the common word "right", the Manual authorises the 't' to be joined
to the 'r', instead of being written below, as by the rule. This may
also be done in such words as *taught* ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig117.png),
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig118.png) *daughter*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig119.png) *fraught*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig120.png) *laughter*, etc.

## 28

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig121.png) stands for 'able', therefore ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig122.png) or
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig123.png) can be taken for the termination *ble*, as
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig124.png) *table*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig125.png) *liable*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig126.png) *terrible*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig127.png) *ignoble*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig128.png) *probable*, etc.

## 29

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig129.png) *ea* is the recognised contraction for 'each',
therefore ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig130.png) equals *teach*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig131.png)
*preach*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig132.png) *reaches*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig133.png) *preacher*.

## 30

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig134.png) *ay* equals 'any', therefore ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig135.png) is
*accompany*, and ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig136.png) *many*.

## 31

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig137.png) is *according*, therefore ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig138.png) is
*accord*, and by similar reasoning ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig139.png) *record*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig140.png) *recording*, etc.

## 32 {#sec-32}

On page 19 of the Manual Supplement ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig141.png) equals
*tomorrow*; to this we add ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig142.png) equals *follow*, the 'r'
and the 'l' respectively being slurred. But for other words, such as
*narrow*, *borrow*, *sorrow*, it is better to write ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig143.png),
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig144.png), ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig145.png) respectively. See Section 8.

## 33

*U*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig146.png), is the authorised contraction for "under",
whether as a word, prefix, or a part of a word, e.g. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig147.png)
*under*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig148.png) *understand*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig149.png)
*blunder*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig150.png) *thunder*.

Extend this rule to the prefixes 'unde' and 'undi'. Thus,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig151.png) *undetermined*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig152.png) *undiminishing*.

## 34

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig153.png) is the equivalent for *first*, and
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig154.png) for *best*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig155.png) for *whilst*.

## 35

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig156.png) disjoined, stands for the termination *cerning*, as
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig157.png) *concerning*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig158.png) *discerning*.

## 36

In reporting the aspirate \[sound represented by the letter 'h'\] may
invariably be omitted.

## 37

In the Manual an elementary rule is given, in all inflections of *y*
retain the y; where the diphthong *ay* is inflected, it is not necessary
to observe this rule, e.g. *paid* can be written ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig159.png) or
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig160.png), ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig161.png) *laid*, etc. The latter form
being the easier in rapid writing.

## 38

In the Supplement to the Manual, on page 19, the author says, "there can
be no doubt but that the device of shading or thickening a character is
_not_ suited for general use."

Some writers, however, are of opinion that it may be used occasionally,
with advantage, in reporting.

The necessary distinction between strokes cannot be accomplished by many
individuals; and in rapid reporting the distinction of the strokes,
heavy and light, is scarcely apparent.

Moreover the joining of a thin to a thick outline, and vice-versa, is a
great difficulty.

The author restricts the use of this device to the adding of the
characters 'l' and 'r'; but it appears to me, that it is better, if
adopted by any writer, to restrict its use to _single words_, and
_terminations standing alone_ and always written downwards.

We therefore adduce \[offer as an example\] this rule, a thickened
_right_ hand stroke, i.e. a character written from left to right,
adds 'r', _either before or after_, e.g. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig162.png) is the
equivalent for *fr* *from*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig163.png) *rk* for *work*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig164.png) *yr* *your*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig165.png) *are*, etc.

Again, a thickened _left_ hand stroke, adds 'l', as
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig166.png) *glad*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig167.png) *people*.

## 39

I will close these reporting rules and hints by a suggestion for very
advanced writers: I will call it _line intersection_, that is,
outline cutting _ruled_ line of writing. This method of
abbreviation should only be employed by those who habitually use _ruled
paper_ for writing upon.

When the outline ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig168.png), *i*, cuts the ruled line
_initially_ it adds the letter "n", e.g. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig169.png) *in*,
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig170.png) *in the*, ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/fig171.png) *in the case of*.

The sole object of the foregoing pages is to give the student of Orthic
hints as to the logical sequence of reporting abbreviations. Wherever it
is easier to write a word in any other way, full or otherwise, write it
so, for it will be quicker for you. You must 'think' in shorthand, if I
may so say, before you can become absolutely proficient, be able to
'see' the outline of every word directly it is spoken and use your
context judiciously.

## Mr Gladstone at Liverpool

### English

I have listened, My Lord Mayor, with the warmest sympathy to the
speeches of those who have gone before me, and I desire to associate
myself with them in the closest manner, it is true, Ladies and
Gentlemen, that I have lived a long political life, and that I have
borne high, and responsible office; but it is not in regard to either of
these circumstances that I now come before you, and I make no claim to
authority in any shape. I come here as a loyal subject of her Majesty
and especially as having been admitted, through the kindness of the
Local Authority, to call myself your fellow townsman, as the possessor
of the freedom of Liverpool. It has been well said that we stand today
upon a higher platform than the platform of party. There is no man here
whatever his opinions on ordinary politics may be, who will scruple to
own or appear as if he were ashamed of them; but the national platform
on which we stand gives a higher claim and greater authority to these
sentiments, which, as we believe, are universally entertained from one
end of the country to the other. And, my Lord Mayor, I will say for
myself that, as on this occasion it is a duty to renounce all Party
sympathy and party recollections, so it is a duty most easy to perform.
I, for my part, entertain not only a lively hope, but a strong belief,
that when in the course of time we are made more largely acquainted with
the inter-relations of Governments in the transactions of the last two
years, we shall find that the present deplorable situation, to
whomsoever it may be due, is not due either to the act of defaults of
the Government of the great country. Now my Lord Mayor, I come to the
resolution which I have undertaken to move. There are certain subjects
which I should wish, if I may, to deal with. There are most important
distinctions to be drawn in this matter, especially on the ground that
the sufferers under the present misrule, and under the horribly
accumulated outrages of the last two years, the sufferers under this
misrule and these outrages are our fellow Christians; and permit me to
say seconding that which has been said already, we do not prosecute the
cause we have in hand upon the ground that they are our fellow
Christians. This is no Crusade against Mohammedanism Nay more, I will
say it is no declaration of universal condemnation of the Mohammedans
and the Turkish Empire. On the contrary, amidst the dismal and
heartrending reports one of the rare touches of relief has been that we
have seen that, in spite of the perpetration of massacre by the agents
of the Government, yet there have been good, and generous Mohammedans
who have resisted these misdeeds to the uttermost of their power and who
have established for themselves a claim to our sympathy and admiration.
