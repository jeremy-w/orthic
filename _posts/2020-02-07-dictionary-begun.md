[Check out our new dictionary!]({{site.baseurl}}/dictionary)
It features a notation to represent even abbreviated Orthic in ASCII,
so you can search for an outline in order to get the longhand English text.

The dictionary is also linked from the Resources list in the menu at the
top of every page.

To start with, it contains the briefs from the _Manual._
Many of the resources are already in place to support this work,
thanks to the online _Manual_ and _Supplement,_
but the raw materials need marshaling into shape to make up a dictionary.

Many thanks to [Redditor u/CrBr](https://www.reddit.com/user/CrBr)
of the [Orthic subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic)
for their encouragement in finally starting this project.
