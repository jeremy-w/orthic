The final reading pamphlet for the Teaching course, [Psalms 66â€“83 in reporting style]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 66-83 (Reporting Style) 1897 Stevens.pdf), is now available to accompany the second volume of _The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand._ Many thanks to Reddit user u/brifoz for pointing the way towards this last, elusive book of readings!

If anyone has a lead on:

- the list of recognized contractions issued by the Cambridge Shorthand Society or
- any editions of the Orthic Monthly magazine
- any examples of issued teaching diplomas or speed certificates
- a copy of the list of schools adopting Orthic shorthand that was once available upon request

please do reach out!
