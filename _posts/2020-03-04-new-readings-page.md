[Check out our **new Reading Material page!**]({{site.baseurl}}/reading)
It's now easier than ever to practice your reading by enjoying
some of **Aesop's fables** written in the abbreviated style by Callendar
or **"The Cask of Amontillado"** written in the full style by Jeremy.
(You'll also find the page in the Resources list in the menu at the
top of every page.)

In addition to those entertaining reads, you'll find:

- direct links to the English-language specimens from both Manual and Supplement
- a link to Stevens' rendition of the New Testament

Stevens' writing is a goldmine of advanced abbreviating techniques.
(The text was apparently chosen due to ready availability of the key.
That has certainly proven a sound bet.)

Smaller changes:

- The **Supplement** page now links to the **Supplement source PDF**
- The **Dictionary** now includes **all the Manual's word and phrase images.**
  (Many of the entries still need some work, as evidenced by the frequency of "TODO" in the entries, but the images are there.)
