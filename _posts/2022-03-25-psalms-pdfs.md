Stevens’ renderings of the Psalms, provided as study material to accompany Part 1 of _The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand_, are now available as three 17-page PDFs:

- [Psalms 1-20 in full style]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 1-20 (Full Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) serves as both exercise book and exam for the completion of Lessons 1 through 3.
- [Psalms 21-39 in ordinary style]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 21-39 (Ordinary Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) serves likewise for Lessons 4 through 5.
- [Psalms 40-65 in abbreviated style]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reading/Orthic Psalms 40-65 (Abbreviated Style) 1896 Stevens.pdf) (also called _Supplement_ style) serves likewise for Lessons 6 through 8, at which point you’re expected to be writing 60 WPM and reading fluently. (Lesson 9 is a capstone with some final guidance and a reminder to review  the list of recognized contractions issued by the Society, which list appears to be lost.)

With these volumes, we now have in hand a complete course of study (using 19th Century pedagogy techniques, granted) used in practice to take students to fluency in non-reporting Orthic.

If anyone has a lead on the reporting-style Psalms volume, that list of contractions, or any editions of the Orthic Monthly magazine, please do reach out!
