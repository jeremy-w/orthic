The two volumes of Stevens' 1896 work _The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand_ are now available as PDFs:

- [Part 1]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt1/Teaching of Orthic Pt 1 1896 Stevens.pdf) is 19 pages (including the front and back cover) and provides a series of 9 lessons for teaching the base system.
- [Part 2]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teaching/pt2/Teaching of Orthic Pt 2 1896 Stevens.pdf) extends the system by providing rules for reporting that build on the existing shortening techniques. It adds one character, a vertical bar for B, which is to be used only medially (so: not in bat, not in tab, yes in tabby). The file has 18 pages, again including the covers in that count.

These were published 4 years after the _Supplement_ and, I believe, complete the entire Orthic shorthand theory as developed by the Cambridge Shorthand Society.
